# Blackjack Program Requirements and Game Rules
# Blackjack is a game that is played using cards
# The goal of the  game is to add up your cards to the largest number without going over 21
# If the cards in yur hand add up  to more than 21,then it's called a bust and it means that you lose immediately
# Now the way the cards is counted is that al the cards from 2 to 10 count as their face value
# A 2 is a 2,6 is a 6 etc
# But the jack,Queen and King each count as 10 and the other special card is the Ace
# Ace can count as 1 or 11 depending if you have gone over 21 or if you are under 21
